Week 5 - Monday

1. 3 coding conventions I am good at following already are:
    4.1 Line Length (keeping lines short so that they are visible), 
    7.4 if, if-else, if else-if else statements (keeping form with {}), 
    8.1 Blank Lines (between sections, methods, and class definitions)

2. 3 coding conventions I will start using more consistently are:
    8.2 Blank Spaces (a keyword followed by () should be separated with a space),
    10.5.2 Returning Values (making intent of code clear and straight to the point),
    6.2 Initialization (try to initialize local variables where declared)

3. It is important to follow coding conventions and write clean code because
    it allows code to be read, understandable, and updatable by other 
    developers when working in a team. It also benefits the original developer, as
    the original developer can also have better readability of their own code.
