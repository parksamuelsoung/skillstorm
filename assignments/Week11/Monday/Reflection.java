     * Reflection of Exam Performance
     * 
     * Enthuware for OCA
     * - I'm steadily making progress from the first exam until now.
     *  I started with a 53 on the foundations test and then went to
     *  55, 55, 52, 70, 57, and 64 on test 6. I scheduled my test for
     *  February 9th at 10:00a EST. I am learning to portion my time
     *  between each question instead of excessively lingering on a
     *  tough question. I find Dr. Sean Kennedy's explanations on 
     *  the Enthuware explanations very helpful. Overall, I'm looking
     *  forward to taking the exam.
