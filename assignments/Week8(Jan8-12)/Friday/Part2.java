     * OCA Enthuware Test 2 Review
     * 
     * 1. The type of questions that were the hardest for me are questions from
     *    the category: Working with Java Data Types. In this category, I missed 
     *    4 questions: 33, 43, 45, and 52. The solutions to these questions are 
     *    very specific, and I learned some key points. (1) 012 is a valid octal
     *    number and can be used to initialize a primitive, (2) any primitive
     *    initialization with a decimal will automatically be considered a double,
     *    (3) any primitive initialization with a decimal must explicitly be 
     *    casted to a float if desired, (4) wrapper classes for primitives are
     *    final, String class are final, System class is final, and number is not
     *    final, (5) automatic variables or local variables within methods must be
     *    explicitly initialized, (6) automatic variables or local variables within
     *    methods cannot just be declared!
     * 
     * 2. Once again, in the "Working with Java Data Types" category, there is
     *    one question that I got two-thirds correct with a incorrect reasoning.
     *    The question is number 28, and it asks about a specific wrapper class:
     *    Boolean. I learned that (1) the Boolean wrapper class will actually 
     *    read and take in strings as an argument in its constructor, (2) the 
     *    argument as a string can read as "true" or "false" in any case, (3)
     *    the argument as a string reading anything else "anything" will yield
     *    false automatically, (4) when using the is equal == operator, the 
     *    wrapper class object location will be compared, (5) the Boolean wrapper
     *    class will not auto-unbox the argument passed into its constructor to 
     *    compare with an is equal operator, (6) an arguement of null in the
     *    constructor will also yield false. 
     * 
     * 3. I really like the Youtube videos of Dr. Kennedy provided by enthuware's
     *    explanations. I watched him explain the Boolean wrapper class published
     *    at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_naRsroUxnQ (Shared with peers on
     *    discord). He talks about how equivalent compares object references, how
     *    primitives being compared to objects will result in false, and how
     *    there is no no-args constructor in the Boolean class.
