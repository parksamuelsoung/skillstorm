Week 15 Thursday Assignment

1. I enjoyed the sarcasm with the ninja theme! For me,
the suggestion I want to avoid the most is the powerful function:
"Joining several actions into one protects your code from reuse.".
The reason I chose this one is because I tend to overcomplicate
a single method and add to many functionalities. I've learned how
important it is to have a clear, single, and meaningful function
that works for a method. Something else I want to work on is 
making sure that my variable names are explicit and not vague. I've
noticed that explicit variable names help me jump right into the
code I wrote and pick up where I left off. So, this also applies
to working with other developers who may have no context or 
reference to the code I wrote.
